# Control de Persianas 
Create an automated prototype with the functionality to control the blinds in a room, using electronics and programming tools, looking for a practical solution. Using Arduino as our microcontroller board, where all the programming code will be inserted and its design will be represented in the Tinkercad platform.

For this we have two input components, Photoresistor(A) and Keyboard 4x4(B) and O will act as output. When the day gets dark the photoresistor (LDR) modifies its value, the 2 lights turn on and the servomotor simulates the closing of the blinds. This will have the opposite effect in sunlight. The keypad will be an independent option for the person to open and close the blinds and if the blinds are closed the lights should also turn on.
